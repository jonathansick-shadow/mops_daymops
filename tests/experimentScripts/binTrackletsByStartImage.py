FUNCTIONALITY:

This script uses the DB to look up the obsHistId of the first
detection in each tracklet, and dump the tracklet to a file with that
obsHistId.

This version makes two passes through the file, one to find all neede
diaSources, then one to do the actual binning.  After the first pass
all needed dias are requested from the DB.  This is in the hopes that
reducing the number of DB accesses may speed things up.

RATIONALE:

In order to get a better load distribution (sorta...) of our
linkTracklets runs, we'd like to distribute workloads by image rather
than night.  To do this we need to separate out the tracklets by first
image time.  Since there are a LOT of tracklets, we're going to put
them into carefully-named files rather than put them into the DB.
