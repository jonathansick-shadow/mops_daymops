""" jmyers march 19, 2012

this is a script for reading the output of orbit_server.x into a DB
table for later analysis/attribution/precovery. 

Say you had a set of tracks e.g. my.tracks built from diaSources dias.miti.  You then used
buildOrbitServerInput.py to create lots of files for orbit_server.
Then you used runOrbitServer.sh and got lots of .out.orbit files.

Give this script the following:

my.tracks dias.miti path/to/\*.orbit.out 

Remember to escape the \* (or whatever regexp you use) - we want
Python to expand it, not the shell.
