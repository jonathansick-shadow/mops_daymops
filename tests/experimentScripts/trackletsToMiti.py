Kubica's version of findTracklets takes input as a set of MITI
detections, where detections with the same ID belong to the same
tracklet.

My version takes a series of MITI detections with unique ids, and a series of indices into
the detections file (NOT DETECTION IDS).

This takes the latter version (created with, say, make20DayWindows.py)
and converts to the former, Kubica version. This will be used for
side-by-side comparison of Kubica C vs. my C++ LinkTracklets versions.
