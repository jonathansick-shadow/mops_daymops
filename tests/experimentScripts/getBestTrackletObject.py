jmyers

Given a set of tracklets as diaIds, find the one true tracklet per
object seen which has the longest deltaTime from first to last
endpoint, then write this to the output file.  False tracklets are all
written to output.


The original impetus for this file was to be used in order to
understand the relationship between redundant true tracklets and track
output set size.  By removing all but the best tracklet associated
with each object, we expect the number of tracks to decrease
dramatically.
