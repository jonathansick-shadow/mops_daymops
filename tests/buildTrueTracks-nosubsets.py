read through detections with ground-truth data.  We ASSUME that the
data is sorted first by object ID.

Find the true tracks that would be found by
findTracklets/linkTracklets and write them to output.

Caveats:

Cheats somewhat on guessing night numbers, does not use GMT. 

When simulating linkTracklets, does not make use of the quality-of-fit
of detections to endpoints: only the acceleration implied by the
endpoint tracklets is considered when deciding if tracklets should be
used to form a track.

FindTracklets simulation does not attempt to simulate the correct
behavior of findTracklets (PHT mode) or
findTracklets+CollapseTracklets. Instead, we simply generate at most
one tracklet per detection.
