FUNCTIONALITY:

The previous version of this script read tracklets from a single file,
then read diaSources from a DB.

This version reads tracklets from a set of files and fetches
diaSources from a flat file (Lynne format, which includes obsHistId.)
This is advantageous when there are many tracklets and the dias file
is local but the DB is non-local (e.g. running on Teragrid, where the
DB is in Tucson)

It then groups the tracklets by their start image, which greatly
simplifies the process of building inputs for linkTracklets.
