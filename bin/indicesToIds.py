This script is for those who want to know what DiaSources go with which Track.

the current version of C linkTracklets "loses" the IDs of the
DiaSources used as input when we construct .tracklet.miti files from
the tracklets and detections.

Then, our new version of C LinkTracklets expresses its tracks as sets
of line numbers (array indices) into the .tracklet.miti files.  

use ../../makeCheatSheetForMITIFiles.py to get the Ids and MJDs of
DiaSources used at each of the lines in the .tracklet.miti files.
Then use this script to convert from the output of C linkTracklets
(sets of line numbers) over to sets of DiaSourceIds.

This modified version alters a SINGLE OUTPUT FILE specified as its one argument.
