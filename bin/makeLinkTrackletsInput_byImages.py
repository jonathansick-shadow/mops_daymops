Bin tracklets into multiple outfiles; write the start_t_range value
for each one.  Create each outfile s.t. it contains data from one
night or at most some fixed number of start images; this will improve
load-balancing per run and hopefully keep us from exhausting our
per-process allocations on abe.

our old script for making input files for linkTracklets
(make15DayWindows.py) was based on the assumption that we would run
linkTracklets sequentially, without a per-process time limit.

On Abe, we have to fit all our work into a known time limit before the
cluster kills our job.  Also, we would like to get better parallelism.
